# Advanced krunker group edit
Adds a Javascript console on the bottom left corner of Krunker editor.

Similar to Bob_lap's specific property editor, but more comfort to use.

Can be closed while not used.

Useful for massive trigger circuits, coloring objects with a gradient, changing health or respawn timers and way more.
